## Introduction
This project aims to develop an intuitive, portable, extensible and easy to use web Application for tracking birds from GPS data.

The app needs to obtain the data from different GPS providers, to store it in a database, to display data in a graphical view and to be able to export this data and information in different formats.

## GPS Devices 
We are currently working to support data format for the following GPS providers:
* Argos Microwave
* Mouvebank
* Ecotone
* microwave 
 
## Dependencies for the WebApp:
 * Django >= 1.8.7
 * Python 3.5
 * PostgreSQL >= 9.1
 * psycopg2 >= 2.4.5
